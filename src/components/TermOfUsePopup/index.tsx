IV. PROPRIETARY RIGHT

1. Derion.io owns all rights, names, logos, and other marks used on the site and the interface. This includes copyrights in and to any content, code, data, or other materials that users may access or use on or through the site or the interface. However, the code for the Derion Protocol and the Interface (app.Derion.io) deployed on IPFS is open-sourced. It means that the code is publicly available and can be used, copied, modified, and distributed by anyone. Except for the rights explicitly mentioned in the terms and conditions, your use or access to the site or the interface does not grant you any ownership or other rights.

2. Derion.io has the right to use and share any comments, bug reports, ideas, or other feedback provided by users, including suggestions for improvement. Users agree that Derion.io is free to use or not use the feedback received as they see fit, including copying and sharing it with third parties. Derion.io has no obligation to users regarding the feedback provided.

V, MODIFICATION, SUSPENSION, AND TERMINATION

1. Derion.io reserves the right, at their sole discretion and with or without prior notice, to modify, suspend, or disable the Site or the Interface, either temporarily or permanently, in whole or in part, for any reason. Upon termination of access, your right to use the Site or the Interface will immediately cease. However, it's worth noting that the code of the interface is not hosted or owned by Derion.io, so it may still be accessible via a third party. Derion.io will not be held liable for any losses incurred as a result of any modifications, suspensions, or terminations of the Site or the Interface.

2. Derion.io may make revisions to the Terms from time to time.

By continuing to access or use the Site or the Interface after the revised Terms become effective, users agree to be bound by the updated Terms.

VI, RISKS

1. The use of technology related to blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies carries inherent risks that users assume by accessing transactions. Derion.io does not own or control the underlying software that forms blockchain networks. The software underlying blockchain networks is open-source, allowing anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the Interface, users acknowledge and agree to the following:

Derion.io is not responsible for the operation of the open-source software and networks underlying the Interface.

There is no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of the underlying software and networks.

The underlying networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as forks, which can significantly impact the Interface.

Users are responsible for securing their private keys. Derion.io does not have access to users' private keys. If users lose control of their private keys, they will permanently and irreversibly lose access to any blockchain-based network. Neither Derion.io nor any other entity can retrieve or protect users' digital assets. If private keys are lost, users will be unable to transfer their digital assets to any blockchain address or wallet, resulting in the inability to realize any value or utility from their held digital assets.

2. Derion.io is not responsible for the content of any third party, including information, materials, products, or services that Derion.io does not own or control. Third parties may offer promotions related to users' access and use of the Interface. Derion.io does not endorse or assume any responsibility for these resources or promotions. If users access such resources or participate in such promotions, they do so at their own risk. These Terms do not apply to users' dealings or relationships with third parties. Users expressly relieve Derion.io of any liability arising from the use of such resources or participation in such promotions.

3. Users understand that the underlying blockchains are still under development, which introduces technological and security risks when using the Interface. There is also uncertainty regarding digital assets and transactions on these blockchains. Users acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the underlying blockchains is variable and may increase at any time, potentially impacting activities on these blockchains. This can result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Interface.

4. Transactions carried out through the Interface are irreversible and final, and no refunds will be provided. Users acknowledge and agree to access and use the Interface at their own risk.

5. Derion.io must comply with applicable laws, which may require them to take certain actions or provide information upon request by government agencies. These actions or disclosures may not necessarily be in the best interests of users.

6. Users assume and agree that Derion.io will not be held responsible or liable for the risks outlined in Section 9 (not mentioned in the provided content). Users irrevocably waive, release, and discharge all claims, known or unknown, against Derion.io, its affiliates, and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, suppliers, and contractors related to any of the risks described in Section 6.

X, DISPUTE RESOLUTION & ARBITRATION

Derion.io will make its best efforts to resolve potential disputes through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you are required to contact Derion.io by sending a written notice of your claim ("Notice") through any of their official channels. The Notice should describe the nature and basis of the claim and specify the relief sought. Derion.io will respond with a similar notice.

If you and Derion.io cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) days of your Notice, both parties agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.

Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Site, the Interface, or these Terms, or any other acts or omissions for which you believe Derion.io is liable, including but not limited to any claim or controversy as to arbitrability ("Dispute"), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration under the Corte Civil y Mercantil de Arbitraje (CIMA). You understand and agree that you are required to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration. The arbitration will be confidential and conducted before a single arbitrator, who will be selected in accordance with the CIMA rules. The arbitration will typically take place in Madrid, Spain, unless you and Derion.io agree on a different location. Unless otherwise agreed, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

It is important to note that any claim arising out of or related to these Terms, the Site, or the Interface must be filed within one year after the claim arises. Failure to do so may result in the claim being permanently barred, meaning you and Derion.io will not have the right to assert the claim.
